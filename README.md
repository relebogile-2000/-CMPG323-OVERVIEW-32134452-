# CMPG323 OVERVIEW <32134452>
The overview of Agile and Scrum Project (Project 1), the main repository

in each project there has to be a git.ignore file, because a git.ignore file will help with ignoring files and lines that the owner does not want in the repository (could be files of a certain type, eg files ending in .py, which are python files). Git.ignore files are used to ignore blank lines in the files inside the repository, they are also there to ignore patterns, like line 1 above has # and it will be ignored when reading the README file. They only work inside of their directory.  

The storage of credentials 
if the credentials and sensitive information is saved in the cache, the cache only keeps the credentials in the memory for a certain amount of time . The credentials and sensitive information are not stored on the disk of the device, and they are removed/ deleted from the cache after about 10 - 15 minutes.
if the credentials and sensitive information are in store mode then they are saved on the disk and they will not be removed / deleted until the owner changes the credentials themselves on the GitHost.
