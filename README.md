The storage of credentials 
if the credentials and sensitive information is saved in the cache, the cache only keeps the credentials in the memory for a certain amount of time . The credentials and sensitive information are not stored on the disk of the device, and they are removed/ deleted from the cache after about 10 - 15 minutes.
if the credentials and sensitive information are in store mode then they are saved on the disk and they will not be removed / deleted until the owner changes the credentials themselves on the GitHost.
